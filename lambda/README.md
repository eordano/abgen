# abgen-lambda

The asset-bundle conversion pipeline as **one binary for AWS Lambda**: a
deployment event goes in; converted bundles and manifests go to the CDN
bucket; a finished-event goes to the asset-bundle-registry queue.

No async runtime — the Lambda runtime API is served with the same blocking
`ureq` the rest of abgen uses, and the handler is plain synchronous Rust
around `abgen::live::Proxy::build_entity_into_corpus`.

## Dual-emit

All configured platforms (default `windows,mac`) are built in one invocation.
Texture encoding — the dominant CPU cost — is platform-independent and cached
process-wide (`abgen::texencode_cache`), so the second platform reuses the
first platform's BC7/DXT encodes and costs roughly serialization only. The
per-entity hit/miss counts are logged and returned in the response.

## Status

| step | what | state |
|------|------|-------|
| 1 | texture-encode cache (dual-emit) | done |
| 2 | event parsing, `--once` local mode, dual-platform conversion | done |
| 3 | S3 publishing — abgen's native "space" writes bundles + manifests through during the build; no `.br` variants (no client of this pipeline fetches them) | done |
| 4 | registry SQS notification | deferred (registry duplicate is a follow-up) |
| 5 | already-converted skip (entity-level manifest check) **and** per-file asset reuse (space probe per digest-named glb) | done |
| 6 | container image (`nix build .#lambdaImage`) | done |

## Local run (no AWS)

```bash
cargo build --release -p abgen-lambda      # workspace member; binary in target/release/
OUT_ROOT=/tmp/ab-out ./target/release/abgen-lambda --once lambda/examples/event-manual.json
```

Leaves the corpus under `OUT_ROOT/{entityId}/{platform}/` plus
`{platform}.manifest.json`, prints a summary JSON including the
texture-encode cache stats — with `windows,mac` the mac pass should be almost
all hits.

## Configuration (env)

| var | default | meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `PLATFORMS` | `windows,mac` | build targets per entity, in order |
| `AB_VERSION` | `v49` | manifest/key version tag |
| `ABGEN_CACHE_DIR` | `$TMPDIR/abgen-cache` | content download cache (point at `/tmp` on Lambda) |
| `CONTENT_SERVER_URL` | foundation catalyst | fallback when the event carries none |
| `OUT_ROOT` | `$TMPDIR/abgen-lambda-out` | local conversion output root |
| `ABGEN_S3_ENDPOINT` | — | S3 endpoint (e.g. `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`); **required to enable publishing** — unset leaves output on disk only |
| `ABGEN_S3_BUCKET` | — | CDN bucket name |
| `ABGEN_S3_REGION` | `AWS_REGION` → `us-east-1` | bucket region |
| `ABGEN_S3_PATH_STYLE` | off | path-style addressing (minio/localstack) |
| `ABGEN_S3_READ_ONLY` | off | probe/reuse without writing (dry runs) |
| `KEEP_OUTPUT` | off (`--once` forces on) | keep the local corpus after the run |
| `REGISTRY_QUEUE_URL` | — | registry queue (step 4, deferred) |

S3 is abgen's built-in "space" client (SigV4, ureq). Credentials come from
the standard env (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`SECRET`/`SESSION_TOKEN`) or the
container credential endpoint — on Lambda/ECS the execution role provides
them automatically.

## CDN key layout (mirrors prod exactly)

| what | key |
|------|-----|
| scene bundles (canonical / asset-reuse) | `{AB_VERSION}/assets/{bundleName}` |
| wearable & emote bundles (entity-scoped) | `{AB_VERSION}/{entityId}/{bundleName}` |
| manifests | `manifest/{entityId}_{platform}.json` |
| scene sources (`main.crdt`, `scene.json`, main script; clean scene builds) | `{AB_VERSION}/{entityId}/{file}` |

## Container image & Lambda settings

`nix build .#lambdaImage` (`packages.lambdaImage` in the root flake — build
it on an aarch64-linux machine: Graviton is ~20% cheaper and abgen is
CPU-portable). The binary implements the Lambda runtime API itself, so no
AWS base image is needed; the result is a `docker-archive` tarball — push it
to ECR with skopeo (see `.github/workflows/lambda-image.yml`) and point the
function at the image.

Recommended function config:

| setting | value | why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| architecture | `arm64` | 20% cheaper compute |
| memory | 10240 MB | buys the max 6 vCPUs — texture encoding is CPU-bound |
| timeout | 900 s | the hard ceiling; worst-case scenes need the room |
| ephemeral storage | 10240 MB | `/tmp` holds the content cache + corpus |
| SQS trigger | batch size 1, visibility timeout ≥ 900 s, DLQ after ~3 receives | one entity per invocation; whales land in the DLQ |
| reserved concurrency | ~20 | politeness cap on catalyst downloads |

**Shader bundles:** none need seeding for unity-explorer — it resolves the
shared shader dependencies (`COMMON_SHADERS`) from its own embedded
StreamingAssets, never from the CDN. The vendored payloads still ship in
the image under `/opt/abgen/shader` (via `ABGEN_ROOT`) in case a
non-embedding client ever points at this bucket; such requests would
surface as `404`s in the CloudFront logs.

Bundles and manifests are written through to S3 by the build itself
(abgen's space); scene sources are published by the handler afterwards.
The space sets plain content types and no Cache-Control — **cache policy
must live on the CDN distribution**: long/immutable TTLs for
`{AB_VERSION}/…` (keys are content-addressed) and TTL 0 for `manifest/…`.
No `.br` siblings (see step 3 note above).

## Per-file asset reuse

Inside the build, every digest-named scene glb is HEAD-probed at
`{AB_VERSION}/assets/{name}` and skipped when it already exists (it still
appears in the manifest) — the consumer-server's `cachedHashes` mechanism,
natively. A redeployed scene with one changed model converts one model.
`"force": true` bypasses the entity-level manifest skip, but per-file reuse
still applies: existing canonical bundles are never overwritten (their keys
are content-addressed, so a differing bundle gets a different name).

## Event shapes accepted

SQS record batches whose bodies are catalyst `DeploymentToSqs` payloads
(`{"entity":{"entityId":…},"contentServerUrls":[…]}`), or a plain
`{"entityId":…, "contentServerUrl":…}` for manual invokes. LOD jobs
(`lods` present) are acknowledged and skipped — LOD generation stays on the
Unity pipeline. `"force": true` in either shape bypasses the
already-converted skip.

## Already-converted skip

Before converting, each configured platform's `manifest/{entityId}_{platform}.json`
is fetched from the bucket. A platform is skipped when the manifest exists,
has `exitCode == 0` and matches the current `AB_VERSION` — the
consumer-server's `shouldIgnoreConversion` semantics. Partially-converted
entities rebuild only the missing targets; when everything is current, the
invocation returns `{"skipped": "already-converted"}` in seconds. Any
fetch/parse problem fails open (converts) — uploads are idempotent.
